## Introduction

The Service Signin and Signup API is a RESTful web service that allows users to sign in and sign up for an application or service. It provides secure authentication and registration endpoints, allowing developers to integrate user management functionality into their applications.

## Installation

To run the Service Signin and Signup API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   cd your-repo
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide the necessary environment variables. For example:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

The API should now be running locally on the specified port.

## Usage

To use the Service Signin and Signup API, send HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints. The API supports both JSON and form-urlencoded request bodies, and returns JSON responses.

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available in the API:

- `POST /api/signup`: Creates a new user account.
- `POST /api/signin`: Authenticates a user and returns an access token.
- `GET /api/user/:id`: Retrieves user information by ID.

For detailed information on each endpoint, including request and response examples, refer to the API documentation.

## Authentication

The Service Signin and Signup API uses token-based authentication. After successful sign-in, the API returns an access token that should be included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests as a bearer token.

Example:

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

Ensure the access token is kept secure and sent with every authenticated request.

## Error Handling

The API follows standard HTTP status codes for indicating success or failure of a request. In case of an error, the API returns a JSON response with an appropriate error message and status code.

For example:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid credentials",
  "status": 401
}
```

Refer to the API documentation for a list of possible error responses and their meanings.
